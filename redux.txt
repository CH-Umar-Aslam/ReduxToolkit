react redux is for implementing redux
start with store {only one  in a app}
in store a configure store
reducers for data flow;
for slice create slice a name of slice initialstate{default state of store} list of reducers;
feature are also said to be slice;
by default initialstate wil be some DS like aray ,id whatever
in reducers we will do key functions
two things will be accesable state,action
state: updated state value in the store
actions:action.payload
And then push in store 
export indivisual functionalitty ; 10 reducers 10 exports
and main export of reducers
components we have to send value use dispatch, in dispatch send reducer 
e.g add todo
for using or selecting value or retrieving from store 
use useselector 
put in variable;
remove todo
we have to send action in store;
